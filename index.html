    <p>I love reading because the books take me to such different worlds with their own rules, languages, and magical powers. 
    <br> Reading allows me to learn new words and learn writing skills. Reading expands my imagination and inspires me to write my own stories.

    <p>I would reccomend the series the Lunar Chronicles by Marissa Meyer. These books are my favorite books ever! These books are a mix between Fantasy & Sci-Fi.
    <br> This series is about a cyborg girl named Cinder who lives in New Beijing, this book takes place in the future! She is the best Mechanic in all of New Beijing.
    <br> One day, she meets Prince Kai of New Beijing, and her life changes. She finds out that she has hidden powers and more secrets from her past. Over the next
    <br> few books, she gathers allies to defeat her main enemy, Queen Levana of Luna. (Luna is a magical place on the moon). Read the books to find out what happens next!
